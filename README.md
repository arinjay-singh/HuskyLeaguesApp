## Husky Leagues

The "Home Page" is the first thing the user will see, and it will help the user navigate to pages regarding different aspects of HuskyLeagues such as Team Members, Referees, Sponsors, and Fans. The team members page is where the user can get access to any team-related information. They can get info of all the team members in any team and in any sport, as well as being able to see the games, the team selected, has played. The referees page allows users to select a referee, and after selecting a referee they can see all the games and sports that referee is assigned to. They can also assign a referee to a new game, remove a referee from a game, update referee details, and also create a new referee. In addition to those involved in the games, fans can also gain access to HuskyLeagues by following team members, teams, and sports of interest, all of which is displayed in a following list on their home page. Fans will also be able to delete their account at any time. Furthermore, sponsors interested in contributing HuskyLeagues can utilize the app by registering themselves and providing information regarding their businesses and events to the HuskyLeague audience. Finally, the app features three separate directories allowing admin members to view and edit the personal information of team members, sponsors, and referees.
